-  üî≠ Built robust credit risk models that go beyond traditional credit scoring methods in banks. This model 
  can analyze vast datasets of historical loan data, customer profiles, and relevant factors, leading to 
  more accurate predictions.

- ‚ö° This project demonstrates proficiency in machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, and model 
  building for real-world financial applications.

- üë®‚ÄçüíªPerformed data cleaning techniques like finding Null values, Outliers, Imputations and then performed EDA over the data in google colab using python.

- In Feature engineering performed Chi square test, Anova test, VIF, Multicollinearity, Label Model seencoding, One hot encoding and Data wrangling by which some of the columns were removed which were not useful for further process of model building and finally we had 37 columns.

- After performing all necessary actions created a new csv file named 'Clean_Bank_Data' which was used further in deployment of model.

- After splitting data in the ratio of 8:2(training:testing), performed mdoel building tasks.

- Machine Learning Algorithms used were Random Forest Algorithm, Desicion tree algorithm and logistic regression as it was a task of classification.

- Desicion Tree Algorithm gave the best results of classification report .

-  Achieved 100% overall accuracy on the credit risk model using the Decision Tree algorithm.

-  To deploy this model we used pycharm platform and flask framework as a web application.
 
- üå± Major use cases are a streamlined loan approval process, reduced risk of defaults, improved loan 
  portfolio management, and personalized loan offers.
